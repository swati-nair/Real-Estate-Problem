# Real-Estate-Problem

## Problem Statement
* The REIT has hired us to find a data-driven approach to valuing properties.
* They currently have an untapped dataset of transaction prices for previous properties on the market.
* The data was collected in 2016.
* Our task is to build a real-estate pricing model using that dataset.
* If we can build a model to predict transaction prices with an average error of under US Dollars 70,000, then our client will be very satisfied with the our resultant model.
